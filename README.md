## Overview/Purpose of Election Audit
We have been asked to complete the 5 following tasks in order to complete an election audit that took place in a recent congressional election in Colorado. With this congressional election, we are going to find out which county is the largest based off of votes. Each candidate will be analyzed to see what percentage of votes they receieved, and what total votes they receieved. With these counts, we will then be able to find total votes and total percentages in the Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson counties. 

## Election-Audit Results:
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
There was a total of 369,711 votes in total between Jefferson, Arapahoe and Denver county.
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Jefferson county contained 38,855 votes, which resulted in 10.5% of the total vote. Arapahoe had 6.7% of the total vote from a total of 24,801 votes and lastly, Denver had a total of 306,055 total votes, which accounted for 82.8% of the total votes. 
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
Denver county, which contains the large city of Denver, unsurprisingly had the largest number of votes, with 306,055. 
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
There were three candidates in the election: Diane DeGette, Charles Casper Stockham, Raymon Anthony Doane. Diana had 73.8% of the ballots with 272,892. Charles had 23% of the ballots with 85,213 total. Lastly, Raymon came in last with just 3.1% of ballots or 11,606.

The Script for this Module Assignment can be used for any election due to both its simplicty and effectiveness. Using this script, we are able to find total votes and percentages of votes for both counties and candidates. Any election will need to know the results in terms of both total votes and percentages, so in this way, our script can be used for any election. Were I to modify the script, I would simply expand the scope of what the script was able to capture. For example, while we have detailed information about the three counties and the three candidates, we dont know how each county voted for the candidates. Were we to modify the script to give us this information, we could then apply this to any other election afterwards. In addition to this, there are a multidude of variables that you could account for, were we to expand the script. For example, you could test for voting trends based on gender or race. This sort of demographic information, would be useful for any election.
